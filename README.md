# DataDelivery

Welcome to my Data Engineering Portfolio! This repository showcases my journey in building an end-to-end data solution, from database setup to advanced ETL processes and finally to a data warehousing solution. This is my spin on implementing a project based on the topics I'm learning from [IBM's Data Engineering Basics](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/ibm-data-engineering) on edX.

All details of the project are subject to change and improvement.

## Overview

1. **Database Setup**: Initiate the datastream by setting up and optimizing the PostgreSQL database. This will be the data storage system for the first phase.
2. **ETL Process with Python Pandas**: Once the database is up and ready, I will create a robust ETL process using Python's Pandas library, ensuring data integrity and transformation efficiency.
3. **Data Warehousing with Amazon Redshift**: Lastly, to make the data available for large-scale analytics and business intelligence tools, I redirect and structure the data within Amazon Redshift, a fully managed data warehouse service.

## Repository Structure

- `PostgreSQL_Setup/`: Contains all resources and documentation related to the PostgreSQL database setup.
- `Pandas_ETL/`: Here, you'll find the Python scripts and related resources for the ETL processes designed using Pandas.
- `Redshift_Warehouse/`: This directory houses all configurations, scripts, and resources for the Amazon Redshift data warehousing phase.

## Getting Started

As the portfolio evolves, I'll add detailed guidelines for setting up each stage. For now, you'll be able to dive into each directory to get a glimpse of the ongoing work.

### Prerequisites

- Docker (For PostgreSQL setup)
- Python 3.x (For Pandas ETL scripts)
- AWS CLI (For Redshift interactions)

## Future Plans

While the above stages form the core of my current portfolio, I'm constantly looking to incorporate more tools and technologies. Stay tuned for more advancements in stream processing, real-time analytics, and possibly machine learning integrations.

## Contributions and Feedback

I'm always open to feedback and suggestions. Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/nuiben/DataDelivery/issues) or submit a pull request if you see an area of improvement or wish to offer your insights.
